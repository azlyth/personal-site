It's been a while since I've had any form of personal site.

Every time I wanted to start one, I would overthink it.

I'd think about the various apps I wanted to host, like a blog, a git repository, a file server, maybe even my own mail. And it'd be all nicely organized and deployable.

But in the end, all I'd do was think and not do.

So today, simple beginnings:

- A blog at [ptrvldz.me](https://ptrvldz.me)
- A git repo at [git.ptrvldz.me](https://git.ptrvldz.me)
